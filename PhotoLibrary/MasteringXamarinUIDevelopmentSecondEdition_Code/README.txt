The minimum requirement for this book is an Intel-based Macintosh computer running macOS High Sierra 10.13. We will be using Visual Studio Community 2017, which is the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for creating Xamarin and Xamarin.Forms applications using C# 7, as well as Xcode 9.4.1 to compile our iOS app and run it within the simulator.

Almost all the projects that you create with the help of this book will work and run on the iOS simulator. However, some projects will require an actual iOS or Android device to work correctly. You can download the latest versions of Visual Studio Community 2017 and Xcode from here:
